# SnakeGame
My attempt on making the age old Snake game with PyGame
I know there is a bug in here in which if, say the snake is moving right and is longer than 2 cubes, and I go left, the snake dies and it starts over again.
I am not able to find a fix that I understand for the problem but feel free to fix it!!
